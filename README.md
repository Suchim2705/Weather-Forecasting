Weather Forecasting Project

Overview:
This project explores a weather dataset from Kaggle and demonstrates the complete workflow of data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
The main goal was to predict **apparent temperature** using various weather features.

- Explored the dataset to understand its structure and key features.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends.
- Built and evaluated predictive models to estimate apparent temperature.

  The dataset includes daily weather observations with features such as:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Pressure
- Weather Conditions
- Apparent Temperature (target variable)

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   Handled missing values, outliers, and formatted data for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualized distributions of features  
   - Studied correlations between variables  
   - Identified patterns impacting apparent temperature

3. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   - Tested multiple models, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy and error metrics  
   - **Random Forest Classifier performed best with 95% accuracy**
  
   - ## Results
- Model accuracies ranged from **93% to 95%**.  
- The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy at **95%**.  
- The results highlight the importance of ensemble methods for weather prediction tasks.

- ## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
